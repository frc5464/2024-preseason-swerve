# This is 5464's first swerve drive project!
- Starting things off without libraries so we can learn the math behind swerve.
- We used the code from here as a reference: https://jacobmisirian.gitbooks.io/frc-swerve-drive-programming/content/
- Thanks to Jacob Misirian of FIRST Robotics Team 2506 for providing the guide!

- This did NOT work. Swerve is difficult! Maybe we'll do this a different route.
